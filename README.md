## About

Euphony offers custom playlists that match your mood, your location, the weather and most importantly, your style and taste.

Let us know what you want at a specific time and place, and we’ll do the rest. It takes just a few seconds to select what you’re feeling for the task you are currently doing, and we’ll give you a playlist right away that will fit what you want when you want it.

We let you choose the genres, the mood, the activity and an option to factor in your weather and location. We use this data and your listening history to create a playlist that is tailored just for you, right on the spot for the right place and time.
